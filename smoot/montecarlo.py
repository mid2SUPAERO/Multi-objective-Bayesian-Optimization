        Samples the objective space according to the probability distribution
        Points are uniformly generated on the design space, then their image
        through the model is the output

        Parameters
        ----------
        x : ndarray[n_dim]
            Design point to evaluate thanks to a criteria after the sampling.
        distrib : list of smt models
            models of the objective.
        points : int, optional
            Number of points of the sampling. Should be modulated in function of the number of objectives. The default is 300.

        Returns
        -------
        ndarray[points, n_obj]
            point's distribution in the objective space according to the model(s).
